            <p>The state of California is undergoing its worst <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/30/california-wildfires-climate-change-new-normal'>wildfire season recorded</a>, with 1.4 million acres and $432 million dollars already burned up. Governor Jerry Brown declared states of emergency in multiple counties earlier in the season, but he and climate leaders warn that if drastic action isn't taken soon, the situation is likely to get worse.</p>

            <p><a href='http://resources.ca.gov/climate/safeguarding/research/'>A report released Aug. 27</a>, the fourth in a series of assessments comissioned by the state, stated that if global warming continues at the rate it has been for the last few decades, California residents will be expected to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/california-climate-change-report-wildfires-jerry-brown">more extreme weather patterns</a>, including longer droughts, higher temperatures, and bigger wildfires. There are a few reasons for that.</p>

                    <p>California makes up a total of 100 million acres, and about a third of it, or 33 million acres, is covered by forestry. Whenever these trees die, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/dead-trees-california-drought-wildfires-forest-services">dead shrubbery falls to the floor</a> and can serve as fuel for wildfires to spread.</p>

                    <p>California is very hot; the past five years have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/aug/13/trump-reignited-his-war-with-california-but-his-tweet-got-burned"> California's five hottest on record</a>, and the Climate Assessment expects temperatures to rise anywhere from 5.5 - 8.8 degrees in next 100 years.</p>

                    <p>These high temperatures dry out precipitation and groundwater, decreasing the resources available for plantlife and increasing the liklihood of drought and tree death.</p>

                    <p>An alarming number of 129 million trees, about 8.9 million acres, have died between 2010 and 2017. Climatologists generaly believe California's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/dec/08/california-just-had-its-worst-drought-in-over-1200-years">second worst drought in recorded history</a>, combined with a recent trend of insects migrating to the north and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/19/tree-death-california-hawaii-sudden-oak">sapping trees of resources</a>, are the main factors to blame, both byproducts of rising temperatures.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.verisk.com/siteassets/media/campaigns/gated/underwriting/fireline-state-risk-report/california.pdf">According to Verisk</a>, a risk management company, in 2017 over a quarter of California's population lived near moderate or high-risk fire corridors. As people move into these area, more buildings are in harm's way, and structures generally burn longer than vegetation, allowing fire more time to spread. In these Wildlife-Urban Interfaces (WUI) areas, controlled burns of dry shrubbery are also limited due to potential hazards to residents, increasing likelihood of dead plants.</p>

                    <p>Governor Jerry Brown and other California Democratic leaders are determined to fight the climate change. The state recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/03/californias-response-to-record-wildfires-shift-to-100-clean-energy">passed a bill</a> which amps up sustainability and renewable energy targets across the board; 50% by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% by 2045. With this, and an effort to perform more prescribed burnings to limit wildfire risk, California is taking active steps to curttail the global warming issue as much as it can.</p>
